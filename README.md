# The Odin Project Tic-Tac-Toe

This lesson involves closures practice, and designing a programs foundations before worrying about the UI, styling, or interacting with the dom. https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out This is an article that can be simplified into the phrase "Get the functionality working before making it pretty." Which is a design approach that I can appreciate because I spend way too much time trying to perfect the UI of tiny projects that I will never show to anyone ðŸ˜†

## Model-View-Controller

While doing research for this lesson on things such as seperation of concerns, planning a project, and planning a programs structure, I ran into a design pattern called **Model View Controller** or MVC for short. I did a lot of watchign and reading on this idea and will share my resources here.
