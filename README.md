# The Odin Project Tic-Tac-Toe

This lesson involves closures practice, and designing a programs foundations before worrying about the UI, styling, or interacting with the dom. https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out This is an article that can be simplified into the phrase "Get the functionality working before making it pretty." Which is a design approach that I can appreciate because I spend way too much time trying to perfect the UI of tiny projects that I will never show to anyone ðŸ˜†

## Model-View-Controller

While doing research for this lesson on things such as seperation of concerns, planning a project, and planning a programs structure, I ran into a design pattern called <ins>**Model View Controller**</ins> or MVC for short. I did a lot of reading on this idea and will share my resources here. Although MVC is more for huge codebases, I think I'll use it here anyways just to learn about it more. An MVC design pattern for such a simple project here will add a lot of boilerplate and complexity, but I'm just going to use this project to learn about MVC.

I don't think The Odin Projects creators intended a MVC pattern for this project, but they way they write their code seems to follow this pattern, a pattern I've never seen before. I've had trouble figuring ways to organize code on my previous projects so I'm going to give MVC a try for this project.
**I'll be honest, I'm not even sure if I did MVC correctly.** It's hard to find resources that give concrete examples of how it should be written, I just took concepts and applied them with a lot of assumptions.

One thing I found very handy about this MVC design pattern is that console logging all of my data is as simple as console.log(Model). It logs all of my held data in just a short line, I love it. When I see the word "Model" or "View" I know exactly the kind of action being taken. Again I understand that this is a verbose design pattern for a tic-tac-toe project, but I just used it to learn.

## Event Delegation and Bubbling

Previously, I would add event listeners to every individual child object in forEach loops, but after doing some research I read that adding a single event listener to the common parent and then selecting the event target is much better for performance. This article helped me clarify that. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/event-delegation-javascript/ I need to remember this in the future because I've looped event listeners many times and it's going to be a bad habit for me if I don't break it soon.
